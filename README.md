# OOP_JAVA_arknoid_game

In this repository, you can find an implementation of an Arkanoid-style game that I built as part of an Object-Oriented Programming course in Java.
To run the game, simply copy the project to your computer and double-click the compile_and_run.bat file â€” it will compile and launch the game automatically.
